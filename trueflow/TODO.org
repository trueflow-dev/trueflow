#+title: TODO

* Optimizer TODOs
  - [ ] Implement `trueflow::optimizer::optimize` logic.
    - [ ] Pass 1: Merge adjacent import statements (e.g. `use foo;` `use bar;` -> one block).
    - [ ] Pass 2: Merge full-file content if file is new and small (< 64 lines).
  - [ ] Integrate `optimizer::optimize` into `scanner.rs` before returning `FileState`.

* Example repos TODOs
  - [ ] Add smoke test for example_repos/all_languages review block generation.

* Eventually, I would like to have deep semantic diffs, like "this function was
  moved to this file". This would be a few layer above the actual set of
  "change" objects that we have hashed and stored in trueflow. Then, if a user
  approves one of these changes, it can approve all the underlying "changes",
  e.g. the delete in one file and the add in the other. This can be accomplished
  via a smart mix of LLMs and also deterministic methods like LSPs, treesitter,
  etc.
