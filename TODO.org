* TODO [High] Review Chain Of Trust
  Reviews can be signed by known PGP keys, and this can extend/scale into a network
  of trusted code. For example, open source libraries could accumulate layers of
  reviews from many individuals (across companies), and we can cryptographically
  verify who reviewed what.

* Emacs Package (vet.el)
** TODO [High] Basic Infrastructure
   - [ ] Define `vet-mode` and basic buffer setup.
   - [ ] Implement `vet-core.el` wrapper for CLI calls (`vet diff`, `vet mark`, `vet sync`).
   - [ ] Define customization groups (executable path, faces).

** TODO [High] Status View (`vet-status`)
   - [ ] Render "Unreviewed Hunks" section.
   - [ ] Implement `vet-refresh` to parse JSON from CLI.
   - [ ] Bind `g` to refresh, `q` to quit window.

** TODO [High] Review Actions
   - [ ] Implement `a` (Approve) command.
   - [ ] Implement `c` (Comment) command with minibuffer prompt.
   - [ ] Implement `x` (Reject) command.
   - [ ] Wiring: Execute `vet mark`, then refresh UI.

** TODO [Medium] Iterative Review Mode
   - [ ] Command `vet-review-start` (bound to `r`).
   - [ ] Walk through hunks one by one.
   - [ ] Implement side-by-side view (Diff vs New Content).

** TODO [High] Inline Editing
   - [ ] Bind `e` to jump to file location.
   - [ ] **Complex:** Implement true inline editing where changes in the review buffer apply to the file.
     - *Draft Plan:* Use `ediff` or a custom overlay that writes back to file on `C-c C-c`.
     - *Alternative:* Use `recursive-edit` in the file buffer.

* CLI Improvements (vet-cli)
** TODO [Medium] `vet check`
   - [ ] Implement CI gate logic (exit 1 if unreviewed hunks exist).
