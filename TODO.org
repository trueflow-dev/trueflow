#+title: Project Trueflow TODOs
#+STARTUP: content hidestars

* TODO [High] Review Chain Of Trust
  Reviews can be signed by known PGP keys, and this can extend/scale into a network
  of trusted code. For example, open source libraries could accumulate layers of
  reviews from many individuals (across companies), and we can cryptographically
  verify who reviewed what.

* Emacs Package (vet.el)
** TODO [High] Basic Infrastructure
   - [ ] Define `vet-mode` and basic buffer setup.
   - [ ] Implement `vet-core.el` wrapper for CLI calls (`trueflow diff`, `trueflow mark`, `trueflow sync`).
   - [ ] Define customization groups (executable path, faces).

** TODO [High] Status View (`vet-status`)
   - [ ] Render "Unreviewed Hunks" section.
   - [ ] Implement `vet-refresh` to parse JSON from CLI.
   - [ ] Bind `g` to refresh, `q` to quit window.

** TODO [High] Review Actions
   - [ ] Implement `a` (Approve) command.
   - [ ] Implement `c` (Comment) command with minibuffer prompt.
   - [ ] Implement `x` (Reject) command.
   - [ ] Wiring: Execute `trueflow mark`, then refresh UI.
   - [ ] Add a small "reviewed!" animation in review mode when approving/commenting.
   - [ ] Show reviewed vs remaining counts in bottom-right (e.g., 5 / 15), with green reviewed and yellow remaining.

** TODO [Medium] Iterative Review Mode
   - [ ] Command `vet-review-start` (bound to `r`).
   - [ ] Walk through hunks one by one.
   - [ ] Implement side-by-side view (Diff vs New Content).

** TODO [High] Inline Editing
   - [ ] Bind `e` to jump to file location.
   - [ ] **Complex:** Implement true inline editing where changes in the review buffer apply to the file.
     - *Draft Plan:* Use `ediff` or a custom overlay that writes back to file on `C-c C-c`.
     - *Alternative:* Use `recursive-edit` in the file buffer.

* CLI Improvements (vet-cli)
** TODO [Medium] `trueflow check`
   - [ ] Implement CI gate logic (exit 1 if unreviewed hunks exist).

* Product & Platform Roadmap
** TODO [High] Review ordering prioritizes tests
   - [ ] Sort blocks so test code is reviewed first (need reliable test detection).
** TODO [High] Coverage mode + heatmap
   - [ ] Add coverage mode to show least-reviewed files.
   - [ ] Add per-file heatmap (red = unreviewed, blue = well-reviewed).
** TODO [High] Coverage overlay and branch/path analysis
   - [ ] Add an overlay/command to show reviewed vs unreviewed lines and coverage.
   - [ ] Extend coverage to code paths/branches where possible.
** TODO [High] Semantic coverage by AST/codepath
   - [ ] Model how well reviewed a codepath is using AST relationships.
** TODO [High] Cognitive complexity scoring
   - [ ] Compute a complexity score per block to trigger review thresholds.
** TODO [High] Language coverage sweep
   - [ ] Add top 16 languages/markdown variants.
   - [ ] Add an `all_langs` repo fixture and E2E smoke tests per language.
** TODO [High] Review types/modes
   - [ ] Support review types (security, dependencies, performance, readability, data structures, business logic).
   - [ ] Tag reviews with a type and make modes affect block ordering and filters (e.g., data structures shows structs).
** TODO [High] GitHub PR integration
   - [ ] Fetch/check out PRs, map review targets to the right diff, and post feedback as comments.
** TODO [High] Local LLM context helper
   - [ ] Call a local model to explain context behind a change.
** TODO [High] Rust lint/check sweep
   - [ ] Evaluate high-quality Rust lints (deny, udeps, semver-checks, geiger, nextest) and wire into `just check`.
** TODO [High] Installation experience
   - [ ] Formalize a high-quality install plan (cargo install vs curl | sh vs package managers).
** TODO [Medium] Diff vs new-content investigation
   - [ ] Define and verify how we present hunks versus reconstructed new content.
** TODO [Medium] jj integration
   - [ ] Explore how Jujutsu can improve diffing, review, and syncing flows.
** TODO [Medium] Website + docs
   - [ ] Add landing page, user docs, and onboarding guide.
** TODO [Medium] Static musl build + dependency audit
   - [ ] Ship a fully static musl build.
   - [ ] Audit dependencies; prefer pure Rust and reduce OpenSSL/FFI usage.
** TODO [Medium] Vultr deployment (org meta repo)
   - [ ] Spin up Vultr infra and document deployment via the org meta repo.
** TODO [Low] Performance sweep
   - [ ] Audit for performance improvements and implement top candidates.
