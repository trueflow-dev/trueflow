* Eventually, I would like to have deep semantic diffs, like "this function was
  moved to this file". This would be a few layer above the actual set of
  "change" objects that we have hashed and stored in vibecheck. Then, if a user
  approves one of these changes, it can approve all the underlying "changes",
  e.g. the delete in one file and the add in the other. This can be accomplished
  via a smart mix of LLMs and also deterministic methods like LSPs, treesitter,
  etc.
