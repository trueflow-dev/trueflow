Reviewing is becoming the bottleneck to shipping.

Things that are now truer than ever:

- We cannot review all code.
- Existing code review tools are insufficient.
- Some code is more important to be reviewed than other code.
- We need tools to understand what has and has not been reviewed.

Some folks say that we won't need any code review, that agents will review
everything. I think it's true that agents will do a lot of the reviewing, maybe
even most of it, but I don't think we can eschew human review entirely, ever.
If we accept that bet as true, then it becomes imperative that we have the right
tools to review the right code, and to understand what has and hasn't been
reviewed.
